\section{Non-resonant new Physics}

Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) or new physics models is a staple of the physics programs of the LHC detectors. Any theoretical models not contained within the Standard Model (SM) can fall in to this category and LHC experiments aim to search for as many of these models as are feasible within scope (Proton-Proton collisions and within the energy range of the LHC). Within the detection channel of two lepton decays (di-lepton), one evidence of new physics is non-resonant signals. This physics would show as a divergence from the SM prediction in the di-lepton mass spectrum unlike the resonant signals of particles such as the Z boson particle which shows as a peak in the di-lepton mass spectrum.

Non-resonant signals could be the results of many BSM theoretical models but two main theoryâ€™s are presented here and their searches compose the rest of this thesis.


\subsection{Contact Interaction Theory}

The Standard Model (SM) assumes quarks and leptons to be fundamental particles in nature. This assumption is not without compelling argument but like the proton beforehand there is no reason quarks and leptons should not be composite structures or bound states of more fundamental particles, often referred to as Preons\cite{new_tests}, at an energy scale $\Lambda$ we have yet to reach. 

One way quark-lepton compositness would exhibit itself as in 4-fermion contact interactions between two quarks from the incoming protons producing two final state leptons. This is how compositness is searched for at the ATLAS detector.

\label{fig:fd}
\end{figure}

Experimentally this interaction would be seen as a deviation from the Standard Model (SM) Drell-Yan (DY)($q\bar{q}~\rightarrow~\gamma/Z~\rightarrow~\ell^{+}\ell^{-}$) dilepton mass spectrum (seen in Fig. \ref{fig:fd}). 

Without knowing the intermediate process one can write a Lagrangian describing the new Interaction: 
\begin{equation}
        \mathcal{L} = \frac{g^{2}}{2\Lambda^{2}}
                [\eta_{LL} (\bar{\psi_{L}}\gamma_{\mu}\psi_{L}) (\bar{\psi_{L}}\gamma^{\mu}\psi_{L}) 
                + \eta_{RR} (\bar{\psi_{R}}\gamma_{\mu}\psi_{R}) (\bar{\psi_{R}}\gamma^{\mu}\psi_{R}) 
                + 2\eta_{LR} (\bar{\psi_{L}}\gamma_{\mu}\psi_{L}) (\bar{\psi_{R}}\gamma^{\mu}\psi_{R}) ].
\end{equation}
Where $g$ is the coupling constant and $\psi_{L}$ and $\psi_{R}$ are the left and right handed fermionic fields respectively.
The sign of $\eta$ defines whether the new interaction interferes constructively ($\eta = -1$) or destructively ($\eta = +1$) with the DY and is always unity. For previous analyses \cite{CDF, D0, ATLAS} a benchmark model of just the Left-Left (LL) component has been used and defined by $\eta_{LL} = \pm~1$ and $\eta_{RR} = \eta_{LR} = 0$. Here however an investigation of each of the three parameters is done individually. Both the LL and RR cases are expected to behave similarly however the LR case exhibits a different angular dependence than either of the other formalisms or the DY background.
A differential cross section for this new interaction is given by
\begin{equation}
        \frac{d\sigma}{dm_{\ell\ell}} = 
                \frac{d\sigma_{DY}}{dm_{\ell\ell}} 
                - \eta\frac{F_{I}}{\Lambda^{2}} 
                + \frac{F_{C}}{\Lambda^{4}},
\label{eq:DiffCross}
\end{equation}
where $m_{\ell\ell}$ is the dilepton mass and $\Lambda$ is the scale of the new physics. In the case of quark/lepton compositness $\Lambda$ refers to the point at which fermions stop being bound as SM quarks and leptons. $F_{I}$ and $F_{C}$ define the interference DY-CI term and the pure CI term respectively. The experimental signature of this effect is a broad increase on the SM background at high invariant mass for all models while the LR formalism also sees a different forward backwards asymmetry.

\subsection{ADD Theory}
%\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{ADD Theory}
ADD is a theory used to solve the hierarchy problem via large extra spacial dimensions first described by Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos, and Dvali (ADD) \cite{ADD}. The ADD model predicts a graviton that propagates the extra dimensions and acquires Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes that show as a broad increase in the SM background. This is the reason the search for ADD is done in conjunction with CI.
