Presented is a search in the high mass dielectron spectrum for beyond the Standard Model physics exhibiting a non resonant behaviour. New physics such a four fermion contact interactions and the ADD model with large extra dimensions traversed by a Graviton exhibit non resonant signals and are searched for with the ATLAS detector using proton-proton collisions from the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Results from two data sets are presented, the first with collision of $\sqrt{s}$ = 7~TeV and an integrated luminosity of 4.9~fb$^{-1}$, the second with collisions of $\sqrt{s}$ = 8~TeV and an integrated luminosity of 20.3~fb$^{-1}$. The first analysis completed a search in dielectron invariant mass while the second searched in dielectron invariant mass as well as the angular variable $\cos{\theta^{*}}$. 
No significant signal is found in either data set and so lower limits are set on the scale of new physics for several formalisms of each model. 

For the 7~TeV analysis limits on the scale of new contact interactions ($\Lambda$) are set for the bench mark formalism of LL contact interactions of $>$ 12.7~TeV and $>$ 9.63~TeV for the model for constructive and destructive interference with the Drell-Yan background respectively. In the same analysis limits are set on the ADD model scale of new physics (M$_{S}$) of $>$ 3.0~TeV on the benchmark formalism GRW.

The 8 TeV analysis sets higher limits on the LL formalism of $\Lambda$ $>$ 21.55 TeV and $\Lambda$ $>$ 19.61 TeV for constructive and destructive interference. Limits are also set on other formalisms with the highest limits set on the LR formalism of $\Lambda$ $>$ 26.25 TeV and $\Lambda$ $>$ 23.77 TeV for constructive and destructive interference. Limits were set of the ADD GRW formalism of M$_{s}$ $>$ 4.79 TeV with limits on other formalisms also presented. At time of writing these are the highest public limits set on either theoretical models.
