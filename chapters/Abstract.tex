Presented is a search in the high mass dielectron spectrum for beyond the Standard Model physics exhibiting a non resonant behaviour. New physics such a four fermion contact interactions and the ADD model with large extra dimensions traversed by a Graviton exhibit non resonant signals and are searched for with the ATLAS detector using proton-proton collisions from the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Results from two data sets are presented, the first with collision of $\sqrt{s}$ = 7~TeV and an integrated luminosity of 4.9~fb$^{-1}$, the second with collisions of $\sqrt{s}$ = 8~TeV and an integrated luminosity of 20.3~fb$^{-1}$. 
No significant signal is found in either data set and so lower limits are set on the scale of new physics for several formalisms of each model.
