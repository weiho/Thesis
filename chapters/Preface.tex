Following is an overview of this thesis describing each chapter followed by a discussion of work done by the student towards this analysis. The thesis is followed by an appendix containing a previous analysis carried out by the student and additional material and information not contained in the body of the thesis.

\begin{itemize}
\item{ 
{\bf Chapter 1: Theory} \\
This chapter covers an overview of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics and then continue on to Beyond the Standard model (BSM) phenomena. The main focus is on the idea of Non resonant excesses in the dilepton Drell-Yan (DY) spectrum of which two examples are discussed. The first example is Contact Interactions, a model which describes many BSM phenomena that can show as four fermion contact interaction that exhibit a divergence from the SM DY spectrum. The example shown is that of a quark-lepton composite model where at a certain energy level quarks and leptons can form composite particles. The second example given is the Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos, and Dvali (ADD) model. This is a graviton theory with the addition of large extra spacial dimensions to dilute gravity. These large extra spacial dimensions create Kaluza-Klein resonances of the graviton very close to each other and so exhibit signs of Non-resonance behaviour. A look at past results for similar searches is also discussed here.
}
\item{ 
{\bf Chapter 2: Experiment} \\
This chapter covers an overview of the ATLAS experiment and the LHC. A particular focus will be given to the inner tracking detector and energy Calorimeters of ATLAS as these systems are the parts used in the detection of di-electron events used in this analysis. Although parts of the detector will be discussed in some respect.
}
\item{ 
{\bf Chapter 3: Trigger} \\
This chapter focuses on the triggering system for selecting data events in the ATLAS detector. An overview of the whole system will be given but a focus made on the ``egamma'' part which selects electron and photon events. A slight detour will be made discussing the effect of increases in the luminosity of the LHC beam through the 2011-2012 data taking period and efforts taken to reduce high rates of data acquisition this entailed in the ``egamma'' chain.
}
\item{ 
{\bf Chapter 4: Reconstruction} \\
This chapter details the algorithms used in reconstructing electrons and photons from the detector output. It also contains a discussion on ATLAS assignments of $tight$, $medium$ and $loose$ electrons.
}
\item{ 
{\bf Chapter 5: Event Selection} \\
This chapter covers the main event selection of di-electron events for the non-resonance analysis on the $20~fb^{-1}$ recorded in 2012. There will also be a discussion of and need for corrections applied to energy measurements.
}
\item{ 
{\bf Chapter 6: Background Estimate} \\
This chapter discuses the estimate made of the background processes to the non-resonant signal. It covers the Monte Carlo (MC) generated to estimate these backgrounds as well as corrections applied to match MC to the data collection conditions used and corrections to account for next to next to leading order calculation effects.
}
\item{ 
{\bf Chapter 7: Signal Search} \\
This chapter shows the search for new physics in the data collected in the 2012 data taking period. This includes a description of the MC used to predict the signals as well as comparison between the Data and the MC prediction of the background. Also looked at are the significance or p-value of any divergences from the SM background prediction.
}
\item{ 
{\bf Chapter 8: Statistical Analysis} \\
This chapter discuses a statistical treatment of the results. First discussed is possible sources of systematic error in the analysis as well as levels of statistical error. Next a Bayesian approach is taken to searching for signs of new physics and then setting lower limits on the scale of new physics predicted by this analysis.
}
\item{ 
{\bf Chapter 9: Conclusion} \\
This final chapter discuses the conclusions obtained from this analysis with an overview of the results and a look forward to the future of searches of non-resonant physics within ATLAS.
}

This thesis describes the work carried out for analysis searching for new non-resonant physics with the ATLAS detector. The analysis focuses on the search within the electron decay channel following on from a previous analysis on earlier ATLAS data discussed in the appendix. The analysis is also related to an analysis searching for resonant physics for which the student participated in. This work was primarily carried out within a group of four students, one researcher and four academics working on ATLAS. The search within the electron channel was primarily carried out by two students with this student focusing on the Contact interaction model and necessarily dictating the focus on the Contact interaction model within this thesis. The search for both models complemented each other strongly and so therefore and discussion of both is seen as important.
